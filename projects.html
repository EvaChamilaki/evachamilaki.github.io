                <h4>An immersive data visualization framework in a 3D environment, developed in Unity, presents social
                    network graphs within a 3D environment. It features an innovative filtering system for relationship
                    types between nodes, enabling users to intuitively explore and analyze complex datasets. Designed
                    with a focus on usability, the framework offers an interactive and user-friendly interface for
                    engaging with social network data. Suitable for users of all expertise levels and professional
                    backgrounds, it supports both desktop and VR platforms for broad accessibility.

                        games.
                        The game
                        offers two perspectives: that of the victim and the toxic player, with players making choices
                        that
                        lead to different
                        outcomes. Our goal with this project is to raise awareness about the effects of toxic behavior
                        in
                        online games and
