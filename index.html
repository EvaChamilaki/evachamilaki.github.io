        <p><img class="about_img" src="me.jpeg" width="300" height="300">
            I am currently a Master's student at the <a class="about_links" href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>, in the Game and Media Technology programme, 
            and the estimated date of my graduation is August 2025.</p>
            <p>On November 2024 until February 2025, I will be a Teaching Assistant for the course "Computer Animation" at the Utrecht University. This course leverages 
            one of the few <a class="about_links" href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/motion-capture-and-virtual-reality-lab">Motion Capture and Virtual Reality</a> 
            labs worldwide of this scale, under the supervision of <a class="about_links" href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/ZYumak">Dr.Zerrin Yumak</a>.</p>
            <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Crete, in which I graduated 8th in the class of July 2022.</p>
            <p>I had the opportunity to work in the Full-Stack Developer position at <a class="about_links" href="https://www.business-code.de/">BusinessCode</a>
            from November 2022 until November 2023, after which I started being a student. The first objective was to develop a Java application which 
            facilitated the parsing and database integration of large scale Excel and CSV files. The completion of this objective led me to work with a 
            team of other people on the company's User Interface using online crawler to extract information from clients' websites and integrate
            them.</p>
            <p>During the last year of my Bachelor's studies, I was working in <a class="about_links" href="https://oramavr.com/">OramaVR</a> at first as a 
            Unity Developer to create a remastered version of a medical operation, and later as a 3D Model Developer for the various medical projects of the company.
            Due to my passion for motion capture and animations, I completed my thesis under the supervision of 
            <a class="about_links" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rUfyI3MAAAAJ&hl=en">George Papagiannakis</a> on a user study about the most optimal online
            motion capture tool and the results' integration onto Unity on various characters. To implement this integration, I developed a Unity tool, which is an Automated
            Animator Controller with the purpose to apply the animations to any given 3d skeleton, and play a random set of animations. </p>
            <p>A more detailed description about my experience and skills are in my <a class="about_links" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rUfyI3MAAAAJ&hl=en">CV</a>.</p>
